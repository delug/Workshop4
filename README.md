# Intro to Neural Networks

This workshop will cover the basis of Neural Networks and modern deep learning, paying heavy emphasis to the mathematical foundation while also providing coding examples and exposing the audience to the PyTorch machine learning API for fast and easy model development. We will cover the mathematical foundations of perceptrons, layers, backpropagation and computational graphs, as well as discussing how these abstract concepts are concretely implemented in modern machine learning libraries.
